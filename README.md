## Project Proposal

### Project Description

1. A checker board consisting of an 8x8 grid.
2. Each player has 12 pieces, totaling 24 pieces.
3. Every turn, a piece can move only one space diagonally.
4. Capturing is allowed if there is a free space adjacent to an opponent's piece.

### Checkers Board Layout

The checkers are initially set up on the dark-colored squares, with each player having their pieces on the three rows closest to them.

### Man: A piece on the board

A piece that can only move forward. It cannot move backward. Here's a visual representation of how a man is moved:

### King: A piece on the board

When a man reaches the other home rank of the checkerboard, it becomes a king. This allows the piece to move both forward and backward. Here's a visual representation of how a king moves in a checkerboard:

### Game Ending Conditions

A player wins if all their pieces are captured by the opponent.

## Project Objectives

1. Two players can play against each other.
2. If one player is present, the player plays against the computer.
3. All the rules of checkers are printed before the game starts.
