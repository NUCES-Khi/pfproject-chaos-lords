## Project Proposal

### Project Description:

1. A checker board consisting of an 8x8 grid.
2. Each player has 12 pieces.
3. Total of 24 pieces.
4. Every turn, a piece is allowed to move only one space.
5. Pieces move to their adjacent box diagonally.
6. If there is a free space adjacent to an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece can be captured.

### Checkers Board Layout:

The checkers are initially set up on the dark-colored squares, with each player having their pieces on the three rows closest to them.

### Man; A piece on a board:

A piece that is only allowed to move forwards, cannot move backward. The visual representation below illustrates how a man is moved.

### King; A piece on a board:

When a man reaches the other home rank of the checkerboard, it becomes a king. This allows the piece to move both forward and backward. The visual representation below illustrates how a king moves in a checkerboard.

### Game Ending Conditions:

1. A player has all their pieces captured by the opponent.

## Project Objectives:

1. Two players max can play against each other.
2. If one player is there, then the player has to play against the computer.
3. All the rules of checkers are printed before the game starts.
